# TabTune

TabTune is a Chrome extension that intelligently manages audio and video playback across multiple tabs. It automatically pauses and mutes media in inactive tabs while allowing the active tab to play without interruption. Users can also manage a whitelist to exempt specific sites from muting.

## Features

- **Automatic Muting**: Mutes and pauses media in inactive tabs.
- **Active Tab Playback**: Unmutes and plays media in the currently active tab.
- **Whitelist Management**: Add or remove URLs to/from a whitelist to prevent them from being muted.
- **Easy Toggle**: Simple button to enable or disable the extension.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ardent-7322/TabTune.git
